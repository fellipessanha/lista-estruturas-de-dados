## Data Structures Exercises

This repository contains the exercises for the postgraduate Data Structures course at UFF(Universidade Federal Fluminense), with professor Igor Machado Coelho(@igormcoelho).

Exercises from `src/estruturas-lineares` are from the first [linear structures list](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MoBOqarY3BzA8hrPiD-wpuydmJ0ZIRCE/view), and the exercises are both coded and explained in portugueses since that's the language of the course.
